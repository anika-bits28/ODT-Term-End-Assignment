**The Black Box: A Mechanical Nightmare**  

This project constructs fear as a tangible, engineered experience. It weaponizes light and shadow to produce:  

1. **The Flicker** – Simulates dying electrical sources through unstable yellow oscillations, designed to trigger primal unease.  

2. **The Breath** – A slow, pulsing amber glow that suggests presence in empty space.  

3. **The Attack** – Jarring blue strobes violating the darkness.  

4. **The Aftermath** – Frozen blue luminescence where the eyes adjust, but the nerves do not.  

**Technical Spine**  
- Built on an ESP32 microcontroller  
- Controls NeoPixel LED strips via GPIO4  
- Deliberately unoptimized timing algorithms to prevent habituation  

**Psychological Underpinnings**  
Each phase exploits a different fear response:  
- Flicker → Pattern recognition failure  
- Breath → Uncanny valley of light  
- Attack → Startle reflex override  
- Aftermath → Sensory deprivation priming

**Final Note:**
If your LEDs behave strangely after uploading this code, consider whether you invited something in.
